# Color-mixing-theory
The goal of this program is to be used as part of an explanation of subtractive and
additive color mixing.

An interesting use case for the program is a situation where this program is displayed on a large touchscreen. An example of a situation like this would be in the context of an interactive museum aimed at children. The reason why a program like this is more effective than reading a textbook or watching a video clip is because of direct interaction. When someone wonders what the result would be when different colors are combined the program gives them immediate feedback. This helps immensely with the understanding of the theory behind it.
Additionally, different methods of color mixing can be compared. This helps with the
understanding of the differences between the two different types of color mixing.
The interesting functionality that this specific program uses, is the ability to change the colors of the circles. Color theory is often explained with primary and secondary colors, itâ€™s useful to immediately see what happens when other colors are mixed.
